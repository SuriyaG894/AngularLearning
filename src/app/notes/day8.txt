    Routing Concept:
    ---------------
-->First we have to create new project with, 
    (--routing)->This will create new project with app-routing.module.ts,
    where we have to set path and component for routing
  
    const routes: Routes = [
  {path:'',component: LoginPageComponent},
  { path: 'login', component: LoginPageComponent },
  {path:'register',component:RegisterPageComponent},
  {path:'todolist',component:TodolistComponent}
];
like the above mentioned code.
   -> Then we have to use routeroutlet tag in app.component.html
   -> Then we have to use routerLink in anchor tag where we have to 
      do the routing .
      <a routerLink="/register">sign up</a>
      like in the above mentioned code.
By doing this we can do routing.
